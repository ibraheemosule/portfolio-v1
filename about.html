                    adding value to the society through creativity whilst helping ease in young devs aspiring 
                    to have a career in this field. Currently, I am duly proficient in HTML, CSS and Javacript.
                    In addition to these, i am an effective user of dev tools like git, browser developer tools, github etc.
                </p>

                    To aid my exposure and boost my experience level, I've engaged in various remote internships such as HNGi7, wejapa
                     internship and also an active member of the facebook Dev group of Lagos branch.

                <p>
                    Since I started my frontend dev journey, i have engaged myself in series of group projects as well as personal 
                    projects which can be found on my about page. If my work interests you and wish to contact me, please click the contact
